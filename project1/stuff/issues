-mouse position doesn't map to canvas coords?


-'this' didn't refer to what I thought in the object methods for player
  -tried moving outside of window.onload()
   didn't do anything
  -tried adding this.self = this to object.
  worked

ISSUES
  -fix flickering of hand/mouse icon

  -fix random start and velocities.
   sometimes velocity is 0
   start pos is not centered around center

  -spash screen
   -ask num players

  -num roaches random?
   -allow users to select num roaches

  -speed increases as game goes on?

  -change rotation of roach image

  -add sound
  -add splat
