FEATURES NEED FOR MVP:
-Design Layout
-Initialize game/players
-UI components
-game controlling component


OPEN ISSUES FOR MVP:
-kills conditions not correct.  it kills more than one roach.
  -might be that the removal from array not working.
   because score only inc by 1 so that is good
OPEN ISSUES LOW PRIORITY:
-fix random start and velocities.
   sometimes velocity is 0

-fix flickering of hand/mouse icon











FEATURES: FUTURE
-add sound
-add splat objects that clear themselves after an interval of time
-num roaches random?
 -allow users to select num roaches
-select different game type...
-speed increases as game goes on?
-change rotation of roach image



//////////////////////////////////////////
ISSUES: RESOLVED
-mouse position doesn't map to canvas coords?
  canvas html height & width was one thing.  css said another

-'this' didn't refer to what I thought in the object methods for player
    -tried moving outside of window.onload()
     didn't do anything
    -tried adding this.self = this to object.
    worked
    -SOLUTION: it refered to calling object which was canvas() (for mouse move, click, but not render)
     change handling

-start pos is not centered around center
 fixed.

FEATURES: IMPLEMENTED
