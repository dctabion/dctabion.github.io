//////////////////////////////////////////
ISSUES: RESOLVED
-mouse position doesn't map to canvas coords?
  canvas html height & width was one thing.  css said another

-'this' didn't refer to what I thought in the object methods for player
    -tried moving outside of window.onload()
     didn't do anything
    -tried adding this.self = this to object.
    worked
    -SOLUTION: it refered to calling object which was canvas() (for mouse move, click, but not render)
     change handling

-start pos is not centered around center
 fixed.

-kills conditions not correct.  it kills more than one roach.
   -might be that the removal from array not working.
    because score only inc by 1 so that is good
   -FIX: was removing more than 1 element from array

FEATURES: IMPLEMENTED
