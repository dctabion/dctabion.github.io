QUESTIONS
-choices of what to prioritize
-design consultation
 -can I call some function of an object from the object methods?



FEATURES NEED FOR MVP:
-Design Layout
-watch UI component video
-decide on UI components

-Initialize game/players array
  -Loop through num players times
  -set values
    -set currentPlayerIndex = 0;


KICK OF DIFFERENT TASKS
-call do player turn()
  if currentPlayerIndex < players.length
   -create roaches
   -start listeners
      -listen for mouseMove
        -save old position
        -get old position

      -listen for click
        -on click
           -loop through all roaches
             -see if there is a kill
               -remove roach
               -draw splat
                 -increase kills
                 -if no roaches left / level over
                    <LEVEL OVER CODE!> call level over ***
                      display number of kills for all players
                      inc totalKills for player;
                      call the clear stuff function()
                        -clear render timer
                        -stop listening to mousMove
                        -stop listening to click
                      call the prep stuff function()
                        -display score of player
                        -increase player index so next players' turn
                        -set currentPlayer to be players[currentPlayerIndex]
                      call the do player function to kick off again

   -start rendering periodically
      -erase the roaches
      -erase the hand
      -draw the stuff in order of lowest layer to highest layer
        -loop through & draw the splats
        -loop through roaches
          save old position
          move roach
          if roach escapes
            remove from array
            if all roaches escaped
              <LEVEL OVER CODE!> call level over
                 ...see above at ****
          else
            draw the roach
          -draw the hand
  else (no players left)
  display who won!!!


-UI components
-game controlling component


OPEN ISSUES FOR MVP:





OPEN ISSUES EXTRAS: LOW PRIORITY:
-choose fonts
-tighten up kill conditions based on programmer defined variable(s)
-fix random start and velocities.
   sometimes velocity is 0

-fix flickering of hand/mouse icon


FEATURES: FUTURE
-allow users to select number of rounds
-num roaches and speed can change
-allow users to select number of players
-add sound
-add splat objects that clear themselves after an interval of time and show
 dead roach
-num roaches random?
 -allow users to select num roaches
-select different game type...
-speed increases as game goes on?
-change rotation of roach image



//////////////////////////////////////////
ISSUES: RESOLVED
-mouse position doesn't map to canvas coords?
  canvas html height & width was one thing.  css said another

-'this' didn't refer to what I thought in the object methods for player
    -tried moving outside of window.onload()
     didn't do anything
    -tried adding this.self = this to object.
    worked
    -SOLUTION: it refered to calling object which was canvas() (for mouse move, click, but not render)
     change handling

-start pos is not centered around center
 fixed.

-kills conditions not correct.  it kills more than one roach.
   -might be that the removal from array not working.
    because score only inc by 1 so that is good
   -FIX: was removing more than 1 element from array

FEATURES: IMPLEMENTED
